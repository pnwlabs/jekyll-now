I am a Network Solutions Architect based out of Bend, Oregon.  I earned a Wireless CCIE and CWNE while working in Cisco's Professional Services organization.  Over the course of my career I have constantly found the need to make things easier and faster, because I'd rather spend my time biking and enjoying a good IPA.  My goal is to share what I learn about  automating every aspect of my interaction with the network with others in hopes that they too find easier way and can have a beer sooner.
